# Deploying Your Next.js Application: A Complete Guide

Next.js applications can be deployed to various platforms, each with its own benefits. In this guide, we'll explore the most popular deployment options and walk through the deployment process step by step.

## 1. Deploying to Vercel (Recommended)

Vercel, created by the team behind Next.js, offers the most seamless deployment experience:

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Visit [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) and import your repository
3. Vercel will automatically detect Next.js and configure the build settings
4. Click "Deploy"

```bash
# Or use Vercel CLI
vercel login
vercel
```

## 2. Traditional Hosting Platforms

### Building for Production

Before deploying to any platform, build your application:

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

### Environment Variables

Ensure your environment variables are properly set:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://api.example.com
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...
```

## 3. Docker Deployment

Create a Dockerfile for your Next.js app:

```dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
RUN npm run build
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

## 4. Platform-Specific Deployments

### AWS Elastic Beanstalk

1. Create an Elastic Beanstalk environment
2. Configure your application
3. Deploy using the AWS CLI:

```bash
eb init
eb create
eb deploy
```

### Digital Ocean App Platform

1. Connect your repository
2. Select the Next.js framework preset
3. Configure environment variables
4. Deploy

## Performance Optimization Tips

- Enable caching using `next.config.js`:
```js
module.exports = {
  experimental: {
    runtime: 'nodejs',
    serverComponents: true,
  },
  images: {
    domains: ['your-domain.com'],
  }
}
```

- Implement proper CI/CD:
```yaml
name: Deploy
on: [push]
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v2
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run build
```

## Common Deployment Issues

### 1. Build Failures
- Check Node.js version compatibility
- Verify all dependencies are installed
- Ensure environment variables are set

### 2. Runtime Errors
- Configure proper environment variables
- Set up correct API routes
- Handle CORS issues

### 3. Performance Issues
- Implement proper caching
- Use Image Optimization
- Enable server-side rendering where appropriate

## Monitoring Your Deployment

1. Set up error tracking (e.g., Sentry)
2. Configure performance monitoring
3. Implement logging
4. Set up uptime monitoring

## Conclusion

Deploying a Next.js application requires careful consideration of your specific needs:

- Use Vercel for the simplest deployment
- Consider Docker for custom infrastructure
- Implement proper CI/CD pipelines
- Monitor performance and errors

Remember to always test your deployment in a staging environment first and maintain proper backup procedures.

For more advanced deployment scenarios or troubleshooting, consult the [Next.js documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment).
