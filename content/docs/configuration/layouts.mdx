description: Choose between two different layout options for your dashboard.
---

Explore the different layout options available for customizing your dashboard. You have the choice between two layouts for the dashboard.

## Centered Sidebar and Main Content

In this layout, both the sidebar and the main content are centered in the middle of the page, like **Stripe dashboard**.

```tsx

```

## Fixed Sidebar with Centered Main Content

In this layout, the sidebar is fixed to the left side of the window, while only the main content is centered on the page. This gives for a more **traditional look**. This is the default layout.

```tsx

```

Feel free to choose the layout that best fits your design preferences and user experience goals.
