Blog posts can have multiple categories, authors and related posts.

## Authors

### Create one author

Blog posts can have **one or multiple authors**. <br /> Add a new object with **name, image url and twitter handle** to add a new author to your blog.

```ts title="config/blog.ts" {7-11}
export const BLOG_AUTHORS = {
  magesh: {
    name: "magesh",
    image: "/_static/avatars/magesh.png",
    twitter: "magesh",
  },
  newauthor: {
    name: "shadcn",
    image: "/_static/avatars/shadcn.jpeg",
    twitter: "shadcn",
  },
};
```

### Add in a blog post

Add your new author in your blog post like that :

```mdx {6-8}
