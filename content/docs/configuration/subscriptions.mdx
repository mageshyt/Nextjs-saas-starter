# Subscriptions

Subscriptions allow you to monetize your SaaS by providing features or services on a recurring basis. This section covers how to configure, handle, and maintain subscriptions within your application.

## Overview

1. **User Plans**: Define different tiers (e.g., Free, Basic, Pro) based on usage or features.  
2. **Payment Processor**: Commonly Stripe or PayPal for recurring billing.  
3. **Subscription Lifecycle**: Create, update, cancel, or resume subscriptions as needed.

## Prerequisites

- Active billing account with your payment processor (e.g., Stripe).  
- Database table to store subscription information (e.g., “subscriptions,” “customers”).

## Stripe Setup (Example)

```bash
bun install stripe
```
